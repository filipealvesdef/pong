# Pong

This was the first game that I created. I was so excited that I decided to record a [series of videos and post on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzvSokPj4gs&list=PL1EkVGo1AQ0HXEv5t_8oyC9GFgd4JpPSq&index=1), which had only one video, so far.

This is the classical Pong game, where the objective is to avoid that the ball (square hehe) touches the side edges of the screen. Both players, move only up and down. The left one, uses `W` and `S` keys, and the right one, `↑` and `↓` keys. The game was developed entirely using only pure Javascript.

Feel free to use, modify and share it as you wish but it would be cool if you give me due credits :)

### Note
This code was implemented in 2014 and because of my lack of experience it might be messy and I did not refactored it to keep consistency with the tutorial videos.
